# Shortest Tennis Court Line Sweep

---
If you play Tennis regularly, you can probably relate. You are sweeping the Court and are doing the lines, when you stop and ask yourself for a split-second, what the fastest and most efficent way would be to clean the lines. I recently asked myself the same question and decided to write a short script to calculate the shortest path.
I modeled the tennis court as an undirected, weighted graph as follows:

I came to the conclusion that the fastest path with minimal wasted distance looks as follows:

The minimal wasted distance is 8.21 Meters

Feel free to use my simple code for arbitrary graphs. :)
